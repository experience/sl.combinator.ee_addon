## An Important Note About Support

SL Combinator (in common with all of my ExpressionEngine add-ons) is no longer officially supported.

Check out the wiki for [installation and usage instructions][wiki], and feel free to fork the repo if you'd like to make some changes or improvements (it's distributed under a liberal open source license).

Hopefully this will be everything you need to use this add-on in your projects, but if not please don't email me asking for support; I don't even have ExpressionEngine installed locally any more.

## Overview

SL Combinator speeds up your website by automatically combining and compressing the JavaScript or CSS files of your choosing, resulting in smaller file sizes, and fewer HTTP requests.

It saves previously combined and compressed files for later use, and is smart enough to check for an up-to-date cache file before deciding to create a new one.
