SL Combinator speeds up your website by automatically combining and compressing
the JavaScript or CSS files of your choosing, resulting in smaller file sizes,
and fewer HTTP requests.

It saves previously combined and compressed files for later use, and is smart
enough to check for an up-to-date cache file before deciding to create a new
one.

Full documentation is available in the Wiki.
